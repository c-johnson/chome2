SUMMARY:
  I'm a software engineer with 6 years of web development experience. I do full-stack web development, including UX design, implementation, and deployment. I design in Photoshop, write semantic HTML5 and SASS, code various flavors of Javascript (both Angular and Ember), and have developed RESTful APIs in almost every modern web framework (see below). I have a rudimentary understanding of the web stack, all the way from the transport layer, to HTTP standards / REST architecture, to basic web security principles (OWASP top 10-type stuff).  I specialize in front-end development, typically using routed services with Angular or vanilla javascript/jQuery when the situation calls for it.

  Software should accomplish measurable business goals. As such, software development is only a piece of the puzzle to managing an effective, profitable business. I believe that everything about software design, from the user interface to long-term architecture decisions, should be informed and shaped by the needs of the business and the demands of its consumers.

Once the data has been read into the database, the software then constructs cohort tables of labor transition rates to analyze a cohort’s overall expected employable lifespan. Also co-authored a research paper about our findings. Wrote the portion on how to obtain, sanitize, and process the data, as well as our methods for boosting the accuracy of matches using demographic identifiers.
