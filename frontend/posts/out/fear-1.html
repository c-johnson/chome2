<p>I've been thinking recently about what sets me apart ideologically from other people.  There are lots of different lenses for this, but following Occam's Razor, I want to explain it in simple terms.  In a eureka moment, I found a lens that works.</p>

<p>The best way to understand why I'm such a weirdo is to look at my greatest fears.</p>

<p>I am, on the whole, less fearful than your average person.  There are several &quot;normal&quot; fears I don't fear very much:  spiders, death, personal poverty, public speaking, rejection.  Or I should say, I might be get nervous from these situations, but this type of fear is distinct from the more powerful <em>fears that drive us</em> in our lives.</p>

<p>The grander fears of my life, the fears that drive me, are all intellectually induced.  By that I mean, my &quot;grand fears&quot; are not limbic responses to some stimuli.  There's some evidence that a fear of snakes is sort of pre-programmed into our psyche:  We see a snake-like pattern of shapes and movement, and our brain goes &quot;OH FUCK THAT'S A SNAKE <a href="http://i.imgur.com/GKVJpVW.jpg">NOPE NOPE NOPE</a>.&quot;  These are precisely the set of fears that I'm not addressing in this post.</p>

<p>All of my important fears come from reading.  I've read an insane amount over the course of my young life.  Reading has introduced me to life's more complex fears, with one central fear driving them all -- fear of the unknown.</p>

<p>That is: our lives are lived inside a of massive, unfathomably complex interlocking set of systems.  We can't possibly fathom the magnitude of complexity involved in even &quot;basic&quot; fields like physics, biology, or computer science, and increasingly, meaningful answers will only be found in the relationships between several such systems, with each sub-system retaining its maddening complexity.  We live in a world that does violence to common sense, but Dammit, our monkey brains demand answers.</p>

<p>Every system is scary at first until you understand it.  I've spent a good deal of my time on Earth trying to understanding systems.  The things left unknown to me, as a whole, form the set of my greatest fears.</p>

<p>The models I view the world with rest on a few key assumptions.  You can think of these fears, then, as possibilities that would render the rest of my philosophy useless.  Their occurrence would signal a dip, for myself, into the Unknown; the father of all fears.</p>

<p>If you want to understand how I think and what drives me, you will get nowhere until you become intimately familiar with what I fear.</p>

<p>This post will be a multi-part series.  Each post will address one of my greatest fears, starting in order of arbitrary relevance.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Fear #1 -- I fear political instability.</h2>

<p>When I was young, I used to be a bit of a firebrand.  My family had decided, by the time I reached middle school, that not only was I &quot;good at computers&quot; but that I would be &quot;good at debate&quot; when I reached high school.  Grasping for any skillset or identity I could latch on to, since I was pretty bad at everything else, I signed up for debate freshman year.</p>

<p>I was not a rockstar debater, but &quot;doing debate&quot; had profound impact on several areas of my worldview all at once.  The chief of these, I think, was an appreciation of history.  Most of our current political discourse is very hard to understand without some context of history.  As Keynes wrote:  &quot;Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.&quot;  My version, tailored for debate, is:  &quot;Political men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any philosophical influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct historian.&quot;</p>

<p>In any case, I took on a deep interest in history, and began to read a lot of it.  Very early into my tutelage I had a thought that would soon became my first Great Fear.  <em>I realized how blind I was to the real possibility of political turmoil in my life</em>.  Anyone who has read a small amount of history knows that societies are constantly in flux.  War, hunger, strife, horrible atrocities being committed at the hands of our very neighbors.  Turmoil strikes nations both great and small, rather indiscriminately.  However, to consider this happening in <em>my</em> lifetime is absurd.  This is America, right?  Haven't we solved political oppression and hunger and all that?</p>

<p>Most of us intuitively feel, for some reason, we have cracked the code of human nature, and that large-scale societal breakdown is simply not possible in America.  And this thought absolutely terrifies the living shit out of me.  It's an incredibly stupid thing to let a society continue believing -- that America, alone in history, so great in the wisdom of its design and the conscientiousness of its people, will magically be forever safe from serious internal and external harm.</p>

<p>Not only is this feeling wrong, it's stupidly disrespectful to the men and women who work, tirelessly, to preserve this illusion for you.  I'm just as concerned about the NSA as the next guy, but my concerns step from a place of hyper-respect toward the individual people who <strong>we force</strong> to make these decisions.  The fact is, the military knows <em>far</em> more than you do about how serious and close these threats really are.  How many terrorists attacks has the Patriot Act stopped so far?  I'm sure smarmy members of the gov't watchdog community has estimated the number, and I suspect their answer is &quot;0&quot;, but I <em>guarantee</em> you that the actual number is:  &quot;You'll never know.&quot;</p>

<p>This fear has only grown over time.  There is a trend toward individual self-righteousness in 2014 that troubles me greatly.  We feel increasingly more comfortable making &quot;accurate&quot; moral conclusions from whatever media outrage bubble we choose to trap ourselves in.  This is an insidious trend, one which we will be forced to confront very soon, but is beyond the scope of this essay.</p>
