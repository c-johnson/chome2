<p><em>Warning:  This piece is terrible and contains no information.</em></p>

<p>===</p>

<p>It's 3:13pm, I've just completed my third circuit of the local mall's food court, and I cannot, for the life of me, order a bowl of goddamn noodles.</p>

<p>I must look strange:  An unshaved, unshowered, and very hungry foreigner stalking through one of Taipei's most affluent shopping centers, stealing two-second glances at storefronts and peering over the guardrails into other people's soup looking for a hint of food that looks remotely legible (edible? legedible?).  I don't pause for longer than a second for fear of looking lost and confused:  Looking lost and confused in Taiwan is the most surefire way to attract a helpful local, sparking one of those &quot;encounters with other humans&quot; we are working so desperately hard to avoid.</p>

<p>When you're a traveling introvert, the easiest tasks become Olympian challenges.  My model of &quot;what should I eat&quot; transitions from silly questions like &quot;what am I hungry for?&quot; and &quot;what looks healthy and cheap?&quot;, into now all-important questions like &quot;where can I order a basic food item without looking like a total jackass?&quot;.  There are a lot of variables.</p>

<p>For starters, any sit-down restaurant is a no-go.  You'd have to put yourself on the wait list (language barrier, process barrier), sit in the queue (awkward), hope that when you get seated the menu has pictures (I mean you can't just <em>leave</em> if it doesn't, that would be super rude!), choose between a plethora of unhelpfully dense English translations (pork with green bean, or green bean with pork?  hmmm...), and in addition to all this you'd be sitting <em>alone</em> and taking up an entire table to yourself, which I read somewhere on WikiTravel is rude in many Asian countries and should be avoided if at all possible.</p>

<p>Your best bet is what I coin the &quot;stalking maneuver&quot; of foraging for food in new environments:  Walk around aimlessly in a food-dense area until a combination of growing hunger and fear that after 15 minutes of shadowing innocent diners, someone rightfully called mall security, and you'd have to start all over again at the food court down the block -- grows large enough that you order at the place that looks like those familiar dumplings you knew back at home and call it a day.</p>

<p>...In other words, street food it is again, you sad chap.</p>

<p><strong>Journey</strong></p>

<p>I'm almost one month in to my <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital+nomad" target="_blank">travel-the-world-while-programming-and-you-can-do-it-too!</a> journey, and so far, it's turning out to be more difficult then previously envisioned.</p>

<p>You could say that, or you could say it's been a comical cross between massively poor planning and the worst decision I've made in my life.  I've spent six of my nine days in Taipei <em>inside</em>, blanketing myself in the comfortable veneer of pointless Internet drama, pouring through the dark corners of the &quot;neoreactionary-nonsense&quot;-o-sphere, and essentially regressing into the awkward teenager I was when I was, like, 14 years old.  The good news is that the local potstickers stand, where I've gotten roughly 60% of my daily sustenance from (see above), is DELICIOUS and I've only put on about 5 pounds from it.  Plus, I'm still alive, and that's always good.</p>

<p>How did I get this way?  Wasn't it just two months ago that I was the picture of confident software consultancy, boldly tweeting the likes of Balaji Srinivasan my assured thoughts on how the Facebook emotional manipulation scandal was going to rock America in the context of 21st century outrage politics?  How did I devolve back into a 14 year old gollum-like basement dweller so quickly?</p>

<p>Traveling is all about <em>discovering yourself</em>, bro, and after three weeks of traveling, I've shed most of that &quot;positive habit-forming&quot; crap I've accumulated over the last 23 years and gotten down to brass tacks of who I become when you strip away all of the comfort and sanity I'm used to in my safe, regular American life.  I am going to intimately share with you these revelations, because you and I are like total besties and I do stuff like this.</p>

<p><strong>Do No Harm</strong></p>

<p>If the noodle incident sounds like the thoughts and actions of a manic person, you're absolutely correct, but since I'm pretty sure that the DSM is a made-up fairy tale for justifying the high-modernist delusions of the pharmaceutical-industrial complex, I will attempt a more charitable interpretation of why I invariably tend recede into the type of person that cannot order a bowl of goddamn noodles in a Taiwanese food court.</p>

<p>My first and most fundamental defense mechanism to any uncertain environment is the Hippocratic principle of &quot;First, do no harm&quot;.</p>

<p>I have a deep, unshakable, and assuredly neurotic desire to have as little impact on other people or the rest of humanity as humanly possible.  If I were to be uncharitable, I would say this is born of a deep-seated fear of responsibility, because having responsibility over others means grappling with the notion of justice, and eventually, leads to an inevitable reduction of my cherished personal freedom, and since my primary existential imperative is to maximize freedom, this line of thinking typically ends up with me eating potstickers alone in my bed in a foreign city with my curtains closed for fear of any human contact.  But dammit, this is what I <em>chose</em>, so like...#winning?</p>

<p>I say of my awkwardness like an Englishman says of his home:  My awkwardness is <em>my castle</em>, and if I have one wish for the world it is that I shall not infect it with any single bit of my own insecurities, and if I have to eat at that friggin potsticker stand for one more day again, then so be it, because goddammit insecurity demands to be felt.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I'm a stranger in a strange beef noodle-smelling land.  There's an entirely functioning society all around me, full of people with thoughts, dreams, and bad days, and the last thing any of these people need is an unshaven foreigner stumbling through their noodle line, not knowing what I want to order or what price I'll pay or if I can get two packets of sauce with my potstickers instead of one because one is CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH FOR ANY RATIONAL HUMAN THAT LIKES THE TASTE OF SOY SAUCE, WHY DO YOU EVEN BOTHER WITH ONE MEASLEY PACKET.  Plus I don't know a lick of Mandarin, so that's certainly not helping helping my cause.</p>

<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>

<p>This unhealthy neurological default I've unearthed lends itself to many important implications.</p>

<p>For starters; my first gut reaction to dealing with any unknown system is to feverishly attempt to understand it.  In the noodle purchasing incident, my ideal approach would be to spend the first two weeks reading a college-level thesis written from the perspective of 33-year-old Japanese/Taiwanese soup-servers directly to the audience of 23-year-old confused transplants from Kansas City, starting with a formal culinary definition of the Udon noodle and ending with a Lonely Planet-style piece devoted specifically to the challenges of navigating modern food courts in the Zhongshan district of Taipei City (along with any municipal distinctions between malls in Shilin, Da'an, etc).</p>

<p>This echoes my approach to software development:  If you want to build a startup around tacos, the first step is immerse yourself into the history and development of the burgeoning 16th century tortilla industry, slowly spreading your domain research outward until you've earned an autodidact diploma in multi-channel web marketing, Unix-based devops best practices, and culminating with all of the &quot;Lean Startup&quot; stuff you know you're supposed to read but never have, and then maybe, <em>mayyybe</em> starting to think about a wireframe.  (Sidenote:  In practice, my research recommendations end up boiling down to &quot;read everything that I've ever read; become an exact copy of me; then proceed as usual.&quot;)</p>

<p>I have thus concluded that my natural <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tempo-tactics-strategy-narrative-driven-decision-making/dp/0982703007">tempo</a> for life is slow -- very, very slow.  Accordingly, the trait that summarizes my MO of doing anything in life is <em>momentum</em>.</p>

<p>Before I interact with any system, I need to feel comfortable about a) the immediate consequences of my actions, and b) those actions are somehow &quot;approved&quot; by some hidden institutional force in charge of these things.  Ultimately, I'd like to be able to explain all of my actions to a hypothetical judge in Kafka's metaphorical court of existential law.</p>

<p>This tendency explains why I sometimes have problems (read:  &quot;am utterly incapable of&quot;) navigating real-time romantic encounters with The Opposite Sex (you should play a &quot;dun dun dunnnn&quot; sound in the back of your head when you hear this phrase).  An unfortunate tragedy with the study of authentic romantic encounters is, by definition, no such thing exists:  The whole point of romance is to shutter away that cerebral thinking nonsense and connect with another human through your limbic system (&quot;like your emotions and shit&quot;).</p>

<p>This whole line of thinking stands squarely in opposition to the principle of &quot;do no harm&quot;:  The act of turning off your cortically-centered justice-machine is an implicit approval of the evils that instinct-ridden limbic responses lead your dumb mammalian brain to produce, and later on, it's your monkey brain that has the pleasure of explaining the actions of your mammal brain -- entirely unfair to the monkey brain, in my opinion.  In other words, as my best friend Sam likes to say, my problem with women is that I &quot;think about it too much&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Stop hitting yourself!&quot;</strong></p>

<p>If he were reading this, this is the point where Occam of Wilhem would start clapping from the gallery.  After the show, he would approach me, thank me for the performance, and then offer sage rhetorical advice something along the lines of &quot;so okay why are you thinking so much.&quot;</p>

<p>The funny thing about that:  The entire <em>point</em> of me embarking on this indefinite traveling adventure is an earnest attempt to become the type of person that &quot;doesn't think so much.&quot;  If &quot;thinking too much&quot; can be thought of as a kind of neurological disease, then I strongly believe that Chris Johnson Circa A Couple Months Ago should be the poster picture under the new section of a strange and virulent strain of The Thinking Disease, one which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wessel_Zapffe">Peter Wessel Zapffe</a> would find more frightening than any permutation of Ebola imaginable.</p>

<p>The Great Realization, as I will refer to this period (and I will write about more in the future), was, in a nutshell, the latest (final?) of a series of mini-enlightenments throughout my life wherein I came to the conclusion that philosophy, economics, startup-mumbo-jumbo, and anything else that can be defined broadly as &quot;deep thinking&quot; all boil down to what is essentially a maddening, universe-sized shell game, perpetuated by a virus inside your brain seemingly hell-bent on preventing you from fulfilling your biological imperative of &quot;eat, fuck, and be happy.&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone has this moment in their lives, which Michael Novak expressed best as the &quot;experience of nothingness&quot; -- the entry point in which every adult male begins their life -- shortly before going completely insane, abandoning philosophy, and becoming a Jerry Falwell-esque shill for the Catholic church and a whole bunch of other hilariously bigoted nonsense.</p>

<p>If that's not clear, I'm basically talking about the plot of Fight Club.  I had one of those.</p>

<p>The bad news is that being smart, sounding smart, and acting smart, all happen to be cornerstones of how I have came to define myself as an existentially-inspired human who ostensibly has a say in these sort of matters.  At every turn in my life, I have chosen to forego all other interpretations of reality that don't synergize with being a smarty-pants knowitall, to put all of my identity eggs in one identity basket of:  &quot;Well, if I can be smarter than everyone else, then I can make more money than everyone else, and once I have all the money...</p>

<p>...uhh...</p>

<p>...profit?&quot;</p>

<p>What happened instead was, I spent a little too long staring into the abyss of the intellectual world that defines me -- startups, economics, political stability, media studies, armchair neuroscience -- and found all of it sorely wanting.  By a strange turn of events, money turned out to not be the root of all happiness, god dammit somebody tell me this shit before I go off and base all of my self-developmental choices off of this ill-concieved-implicit-advice of &quot;i know it sux now, but trust me errbody gonna LUV your fat wallet when you older kiddo!&quot;  Whoops -- maybe I should have stuck with the football team after all.</p>

<p>The decision I made, at the apex of a black hole of self-actualization in the narrative of my life, was to embark on an epic journey to discover, in an Odysseus-level fit of roundaboutness, how to stop thinking so much.  I was to scatter my brain to the wind -- to inflict upon my self the world's first self-applied <em>nam-shub</em> of Enki, to put everything that I knew and could recognize as &quot;Chris Johnson&quot; into a small little box, seal it shut with some kind of Egyptian curse, climb a mountain somewhere deep in Tibet, and practice the illusive art of &quot;being a normal fucking human&quot;.  For lack of a better metaphor, I set out to forge for myself a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_New_World_(novel)">new and pure Cantus</a>.</p>

<p>Here's the good news:  It totally worked!  I have never felt stupider in my entire life, and it comes from a place of self-assured comfort to say that the decision to travel was probably the most successful goal I have accomplished for myself in such a short time period.  I am a fucking idiot!  Isn't that great?  Guys?</p>

<p>Shortly after that, I realized the Problem.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>For a couple of months before I left, the first two weeks in Korea, and for two days in the Philippines, I was a new version of myself called Happy New Chris.  Happy New Chris was awesome, but the problem was, he wasn't getting anything done.</p>

<p>It was the day after we arrived to our hostel in Makati, exploring the red light district (hilarious and dangerous.  danglarious.), drinking excellent Filipino beers, eating sisig (real sisig!), and listening to the band play covers of Incubus and Led Zeppelin (!!!) at the local night market, comforted by the warm wind of that beautiful Pacific night, when I suddenly woke up and realized:</p>

<p>I need to get the fuck out of here.</p>

<p>I had heard a tiny whisper from the back of my subconscious saying, &quot;shouldn't you be working right now?&quot;  Keep in mind, this is absolutely correct.  The whole experiment of my departure is to see if I can sustain a lifestyle of working 15 hours a week while traveling and experiencing the world in all of its different-y glory.  At the time, I was 1 for the &quot;experiencing the world&quot; bit and 0 for the &quot;15 hours a week&quot; bit, so it was time to go.  The next day I booked a ticket to Taiwan.</p>

<p>What happened next was very interesting.  After settling into my hostel in Taipei, I plumped down in the nearest coffee shop and immediately discovered that I had forgotten everything I ever knew about coding, business, and managing complex interpersonal relationships related to business-y coding-y stuff.  It turns out, part of the thing about consciously turning your brain off indefinitely is that you have consciously turned your brain off indefinitely.  Whoa!</p>

<p>Over the next couple of days, I tuned out everything in my environment and set myself to the task of slowly booting my brain back up and re-engaging with that sweet, sweet cortical activity we all love to hate.  It was tough.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was that the moment I eeked open a tiny crack in the Pandora's box of my sealed intellectual corruption, the rest of my anxiety-ridden personality gushed forth like some kind of caged, smelly curse.</p>

<p>Within the space of one day, I had regressed a full two month's worth of successfully ignoring the world, and after a bad encounter with a tourist-trap hot spring that was decidedly NOT the same as that Korean jjimjibang I miss so very much, I had already started remembering that actually, that whole outside world thing is really quite scary and hard to deal with right now, and look at this, there's an entirely new SJW scandal I can read about on the Internet, and it looks like the <em>geeks</em> coined the hashtag this time, whaa?!?  I have to read everything about this on the Internet, and oh, I haven't been to 4chan in a while, and...</p>

<p>The rest, I guess, is history.  I did complete my 15 hours of solid work for my client -- awesome -- but I had basically left the One Ring of Ultimate Freedom back the the Philippines and now I wanted my precious back.  My preciouss...those beers...the island...I'm supposed to be on an island...</p>

<p><strong>The Battleground</strong></p>

<p>Here's what I've learned.</p>

<p>I believe there is a hard distinction between two modes of experience in life:  &quot;thinking-first&quot; and &quot;instinct-first&quot; modes.  If I had a degree in neuroscience, I would speculate that &quot;thinking-first&quot; people regress to cerebral activity as a first line of defense against new stimuli, and &quot;instinct-first&quot; people rely on limbic responses and typically feel that cortical activation is kind of a drag.  Look, I <a href="http://baneofyourresistance.com/2009/05/05/neurology-of-resistance-limbic-system-vs-cerebral-cortex/">googled</a> some <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-10/cwru-era103012.php">shit</a> that sounds somewhat related to what I'm talking about.  God I hope that no actual cognitive scientists read this.</p>

<p>Switching between these modes carries baggage, and is amplified by habits that positively or negatively reinforce each thinking type.  The more I am required to think, the more inertia I gain in the &quot;thinking&quot; direction.  In the above example, forcing myself to sit down for a day and re-open the software part of my brain also re-opened the other part of my brain that just enjoys thinking for the sake of it.  Like an alcoholic, one swig and I am addicted again, and I will not shut it off until I figure out what the hell Alexander Galloway is even talking about anyway and look at that, where did those 14 tabs about Bitcoin appear from?  Fucking Bitcoin, always ruining my day.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds humblebraggy, go back and pay attention to the part where thinking is a nightmare disease.  &quot;Thinking&quot; is so often promoted as a healthy activity in our society that it's not until you reach the very end of the rationality rope when you fully grok what a prison it is for anybody going for that whole &quot;happy, balanced life&quot; thing.  I don't want to think, I want to <em>beach</em>, but my sustained experience here is predicated on my ability to continuously make money delivering quality software while beaching, and so, we have discovered the Battleground -- the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything I hope to answer on this quest:  How to quickly and reliably pivot between &quot;thinking too much&quot; and thinking juuuuust right.</p>

<p>It's a dichotomy I'll have to figure out how to work around.  For now, I think I'll just have dumplings.</p>
