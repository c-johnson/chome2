<p>Ever since I had thoughts, I've always wanted to write.  I've always felt this constant sense of <em>excess</em> in my thoughts and a constant <em>discord</em> between my thoughts and the actions of those around me.  I always dreamed that one day I will write it all down and explain everything.  Why I act the way I do, why everyone is wrong about mostly everything.  I have an answer in my head to almost every political argument or day-to-day decision people grapple with.  I have the whole stack figured out, starting with philosophy (Why are we here?), and ending up with &quot;This is why Rails is bad for humanity&quot;.</p>

<p>I've never been able, however, to actually write it down.</p>

<p>I'm not famous, but I imagine the hardest part of being a well-known writer is that you are held accountable for everything you've said.  Worldviews are like a web, and everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of public opinion.  The more you write, or the more famous become, the greater the possibility you will contridict yourself at some point in time.  Furthermore, the facts will change, and while you may change your mind, your clarifications will never reach the ears of your critics.</p>

<p>So here I am, writing-for-real-day-one, and I'm thinking -- <strong>what can I say now that will hold true for me 10 years from now?</strong>  Or indeed, the rest of my life?</p>

<p>I've thought about it for a while.  Here is my answer:</p>

<h3><strong>I have absolutely no fucking clue about anything.</strong></h3>

<p>I honestly, like, I just have no idea.  I'm starting a consulting business.  How do you find clients?  I don't know.  I don't have the faintest idea.  I'm starting a new web project, what tool should I learn?  Honestly... No fucking clue.  How should I live my life?  How do I balance ambition, freedom, and happiness?  I can't tell you.  I don't know and nobody knows.</p>

<p>I won't say any of this in real life.  I'll tell you what you should do.  You should skip Rails and learn Go, you should learn Angular and not Ember, you should ditch Windows as soon as possible and buy a Mac.  In fact, don't learn to code, learn how to design, and in fact, don't learn how to design, figure out what you want to <em>do</em>, and in fact...</p>

<p>I have lots of ideas.  I'm happy to share them.  But it's important for you to realize that I have not a single goddamn clue about what I'm talking about, I never have, and I never will.</p>

<p>This is the only thing I can <em>definitely</em> say is true:  <strong>I think, therefore I am wrong.</strong></p>

<p>As far as everything else?  The worldview web thing is important.  There are some fundamental ideas to my worldview, and without understanding these ideas, a lot of what I'm going to say will make very little sense.  However, everything from this point forward is purely speculation.</p>

<p>Are you ready?  Let's get started.</p>
