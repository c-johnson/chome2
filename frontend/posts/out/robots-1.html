  <h1 class="title">The broader point behind "robots eating our jobs"</h1>

<p>Recently, <a href="https://al3x.net/2014/06/17/dear-marc-andreessen.html">Alex Payne</a> and <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2014/06/13/this-is-probably-a-good-time-to-say-that-i-dont-believe-robots-will-eat-all-the-jobs/">Marc Andreesen</a> debated the topic of how hungry robots are for our jobs.  Both essays are fantastic.  I found myself nodding vigorously as I read them.  In fact, I could find very few points either essay that I disagreed with.  So then, why does it appear they're at odds?</p>

<p>In this piece, I'll use these twin essays as a case study to examine the Fundamental Problem With All Communication.  Since I like to avoid making grand claims, I'll stick to a modest case for why discourse around the subject of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=768h3Tz4Qik">&quot;robots terkin' er jerbs&quot;</a> is limited by problems of communication, and hopefully give you some perspective on how to interpret things you read on the internet.  If all goes well, we'll end up for a better model for thinking about the &quot;hungry robots&quot; problem than both of those authors <i>put together</i>.  I'm an ambitious guy, I don't deny it.</p>

<h1>Philosophy</h1>

<p>First, who do I think I am?  I'm just a normal guy, but I'll share with you my secret of universal wisdom anyway:</p>

<p><b>Your total knowledge of the world is directly measured by the number of different lenses you use to view said world.</b></p>

<p>There's a lot to that sentence.  It's my secret sauce, and now you have it.  Sorry, I guess it's <a href="http://www.thinkmentalmodels.com/">Charlie Munger</a>'s sauce, but I stole a vial from his cupboard years ago and he hasn't noticed yet.  That site's design is ugly, but the point is poooowerful.  What do I mean by different lenses?</p>

<p>When you study the human brain, one of the things you come to terms with is that you <em>cannot</em> understand the current field of cognitive science through one discipline alone.  The top researchers understand brain's vast complexity precludes any kind of one-dimensional analysis.  To answer any useful question about cognitive function, you must pull from multiple toolkits.  You can approach cognitive problems from the fields of psychology, biology, chemistry, anthropology, evolution, epigenetics, biophysics, information systems...  Each one of these lenses has something useful to say, depending on what question you're asking and in what context.</p>

<p>The field of Physics split in two almost a century ago, and still hasn't reconciled the differences between the relatavist / quantum models when look at systems from different scales.</p>

<p>Here's the thing:  The entire universe is like this.  Everything that occurs anywhere thoughout time can be viewed through an infinite number of mental models.  Some of these models will be more accurate or applicable in a given situation.  Still, if you want a rough measure of how &quot;really smart&quot; somebody is, look for people that are comfortable viewing things thorough multiple lenses.  Those are your future billionaires.  <a href="http://ycombinator.com/munger.html">They'll beat you every time.</a></p>

<p>So we have multiple words here, and they're all interrelated but dammit, where we're going we don't need definitions.  Here's a list of words and ideas I'm conflating:  lens, context, discipline, toolkit, point-of-view, &quot;what's your major&quot;.  I'll add a couple more.  An &quot;abstraction&quot; is when you take some underlying phenomenon and you sift it into knowable rules that describe the underlying phenomena without requiring you to know all the details of the underlying system.  This includes every piece of knowledge you've ever acquired in school, and it also includes everything you've read.</p>

<p>The best expression of all of these concepts I have read so far is <a href="http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/03/31/reduction-considered-harmful/">Monica Andersons' description of <i>Reduction</i></a>.  Anyone following along and going &quot;yes yes yes&quot; should go read that damn essay.  In my nomenclature, I like referring to this as a &quot;lens&quot;.  It's a nice visual metaphor.</p>

<p>I can rant about abstractions all day.  I'm a software engineer, it's kind of my bag.  Actually, can I go on a side-rant for a second?  Of course I can, this is my blog.  I think, out of all professions, software engineers have a very intuitive grasp on this idea.  Why?  The fact is, the very first thing you come to terms with when you start studying &quot;computers&quot; is that you are <i>never ever ever</i> going to know everything about computers.  In fact, most people only need to know about 5-10% of how computers work to be effective in their little niche.</p>

<p>Here's a rough outline of all the areas of study I must foresake to ignore as my job as a Javascript application engineer:
<div class="medium">
I don't know how Javascript parses and lexes the syntax tree from my expressions.  <br /><br />
I don't know how Chrome takes that tree and paints the DOM to the screen.<br /><br />
I don't know how the operating system allocates resources Chrome to do the above.<br /><br />
I don't know how the kernel provides low-level unix-y unix to my memory allocations to the, uh, to the heap?<br /><br />
I don't know how the individual CPU register requests the, the uh...assembler assembly Unixes.  Yeah, that's it.<br /><br />
I don't know how the low-level electrical engineering required to understand and build the CPU.<br /><br />
I don't know how physics works to support those low-level electrical engineering principles.<br /><br />
I don't know how quantum mechanics derives Planck's electromagnetic something or another.<br /><br />
I don't know how quantum physics works, but hey, neither does anybody else!  <br /><br />I'm finally safe.  Whew.<br /><br />
</div></p>

<p>It's turtles all the way down.  Software engineers pick one of those sentences above and spend most of their career learning the ins and outs of what's going on within that specific sentence.  Most of them never leave their comfort zone.</p>

<p>However:  The <i>best</i> software engineers <i>must</i> leave their comfort zone, and they do.  I'll state this more strongly.  <b>To be a master of anything</b>, you must understand <b>two layers above</b> and <b>two levels below</b> the layer you're targeting.  If I want to be the best Javascript application developer in the world, I should have an intimate understanding of how Javascript is parsing your code, and also how browsers work.  Conversely, you should also understand how your application fits into the layers <i>above</i> your code.  When you operate on this level, you ask questions like:  How is this application going to impact the businesses' bottom line?  A lot of websites serve marketing purposes, and if you want to write <em>the best</em> applications, you need to understand marketing.  Going upward, by the way, is almost always more profitable.  Keep going upward and you'll end up becoming Patrick Mackenzie and charging a zillion dollars per hour.</p>

<p>(Incidentally, this is why most companies suck at hiring programmers.  For some reason, we picked one of these layers -- data structures and algorithms -- and said THIS IS THE ULTIMATE LAYER ALL PROGRAMMERS MUST KNOW.  I digress.)</p>

<p>Every career involves a chain of abstractions you know nothing about.  You can fill in the blanks yourself for your own field.  You should actually sit down and do this sometime -- I guarantee it will be a useful excercise.</p>

<p>They key that makes this all work -- at least hypothetically -- is that, somewhere high up the chain of abstractions, there is some God-like figure responsible for taking all of human knowledge and dividing it up into chunks, assigning those chunks to different people, and calling it a day.  Luckily, this God-like figure is omniscient, omnipotent, and acts very quickly to incorporate new knowledge into the complex equation of where these boundries are drawn in order to maximize global human utility and minimize suffering.</p>

<p>Loooool.  I know, right?  Who actually thinks this?  Sadly, however, our entire society is organized around this pretty dumb belief.  Our cultural institutions reflect this zombie, vestigal remnant of high-modernist Victorian thinking, and boy, cultural momentum is a bii-otch.</p>

<p>I'd love to break off here and talk about how this fallacy is at the root of the American higher educaiton pyramid scheme, but I promised you robots, and as Caesar said, let them eat cake, or something.  The people.  Not the robots.  Robots only eat jobs.</p>

<h1>Okay, so robots</h1>

<p>The first rule of Fight Club is:  Analyze your audience.</p>

<p>Here's a good lens to analyze Andreeson and Payne's essays:  Both of them are writing to different audiences.</p>

<p>The act of being a good writer is to <i>translate some idea in your head into words your audience knows and understands</i>.  That's exactly what I'm doing with all of these distracting hyperlinks -- I'm trying to tie my weird-ass views into other things you've read and agree with.  Man, I really shouldn't be telling you this, now you see right through me.</p>

<p>What this means is, for every writer/audience combination, you are solving the problem:  What is the minimum number of abstractions that my target audience understands I can tap into to make my point?</p>

<p>If you're a teacher talking to other teachers, you're safe sticking with a bunch of teacher-y words.
If your'e a business person, you want to stick to general concepts, peppered in with some &quot;established&quot; business-y words.
If you're a politician, well... hahahaha, sorry, you're pretty much fucked.  Really, all you're able to communicate is the most basic and universal of words, which is why all mass-media policy debates regress to:</p>

<p>&quot;Jobs.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, MORE jobs.&quot;<br />
&quot;Taxes, bad, me no likey.&quot;<br />
&quot;Economy, <i>middle class</i> jobs.&quot;<br />
&quot;NO, NO YOU BAD JOBS, YOU NO JOBS NO GOOD&quot;</p>

<p>This was summed up nicely by my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-mRfqpgc-A">favorite president</a> of all time :  &quot;You'll need to ask an economist for that.  I got a B in econ 101.  I got in A in keeping taxes low.&quot;</p>

<p>It's very important you stop here and realize that Dubya isn't a stupid man.  He's trying to say something important here, even if he doesn't know it.  What he's literally saying is:  &quot;Look, you guys didn't hire me to actually figure this shit out.  You hired me to say LOW TAXES over and over again.  That's all I can really do here.&quot;</p>

<p>You know, I hate to do this whole &quot;Part 2&quot; thing again, but honestly I've been working on this essay for two days and I need to get back to work so I can eat.  Plus, there's a lot to digest here, and I want to do the original point justice.  Let's give it a couple days and come back to figure out how to stop the robot apocalypse.  There's a lot of work to do.  We've been slacking, humans, and the robots certainly aren't.</p>
