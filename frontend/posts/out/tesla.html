<p>Today, Tesla Motors <a href="#">issued a press release</a> offering car manufacturers an implicit license to use Tesla's battery patents &quot;in good faith&quot; to help build out an electric car fleet, with the reasoning that Tesla alone does not have the manufacturing capacity or scale to replace gasoline-powered motors in time to prevent climate change-induced devastation.</p>

<p>The release was met with a lot of skepticism around the legal enforcability of such an announcement.  I responded <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7885128">emotionally</a>, and I wanted to follow up on my initial thoughts with a more logic-based argument as to why Anti-Tesla sentiment exemplifies a very troubling picture of American culture, and why it matters to you.</p>

<p>Sorry, but we're going to have to learn some game theory.  I apologize in advance.</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>In game theory, there are at least two solutions to any game: A &quot;Nash equilibrium&quot; solution and a &quot;Pareto optimal&quot; solution.  This is illustrated by the classic <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/Nash-equilibrium-tutorial/Nash-eq-tutorial/v/prisoners--dilemma-and-nash-equilibrium">Prisoner's Dilemma</a>, which some of you might be familiar with. If you're not, I would take the time to watch it.  It's one of the most useful mental models in my toolkit.  I guarantee it will change your life.  I'll wait.</p>

<p>Pretend I just waited.  Here's a couple definitions.</p>

<p>A &quot;Nash equilibrium&quot; solution is one where, when both parties have considered all available moves, minimizes damage to themselves <strong>under the assumption the other player is a selfish dickhead</strong>. In a capitalist environment like America's, with no social controls or other factors besides ruthless logic, this is the default behavior.  And it should be, if games are strictly competitive and humans are built like computers.</p>

<p>A &quot;Pareto optimal&quot; solution is one which, given all the possibilities of action, produces the best outcome for both parties (with some negotiable surplus).</p>

<p>The Prisoner's Dilemma demonstrates that a Nash equilibrium solution is not always Pareto optimal. The &quot;confess-confess&quot; solution is the Nash equilibrium. You will always be better off screwing the other person over, whether they are honest or dishonest. The &quot;deny-deny&quot; solution is Pareto optimal. If both parties can somehow trust each other, they will both be better off selecting this solution.</p>

<p>If they can trust each other.</p>

<p>The thing about capitalism, and our dismal history with capitalism-at-large, the &quot;assume the other party is a shitbag&quot; idea is so fundamentally ingrained in our cultural DNA that it is very hard to imagine any other form of collaboration/competition where this assumption doesn't hold.  There's an argument to be made that when capitalism is local, IE, you can look the other person in the eye, you both know each other, and the village will hold you accountable for your actions, this contstraint can be relaxed somewhat.  And indeed, research into an iterated from of the Prisoner's Dilemma -- having players play multiple rounds of PD, as opposed to a one-shot game -- appears to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma#Strategy_for_the_iterated_prisoners.27_dilemma">bear this out</a> somewhat.</p>

<p>I believe our unfortunate heritage with capitalism, and our steadily decreasing trust in other Americans, is exactly how we end up with these intractable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a>-type situations, where no individual party is willing to be vulnerable enough to move toward cooperative solutions in lieu of safe, selfish solutions.  The longer this cultural feedback loop persists, the harder it becomes for any one party to make any meaningful move toward a Pareto optimal solution without inviting an equal-but-opposite increase in skepticism toward the first mover.  And it's been persisting in this direction for quite some time.  This explains, at the very least, why rampant partisanship is an inevitability in a large Democracy, despite it being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis_of_2013">worse off for everybody</a> (including politicians themselves).</p>

<p>Climate change is exactly this type of problem.</p>

<p>When someone like Elon Musk comes along, someone who is clearly is working very hard toward Pareto optimal outcomes (watch or read about his personal history), we simply cannot fathom that his actions can't be explained outside a traditional Nash-equilibrium, dog-eat-dog model of capitalism.</p>

<p>Of course, this applies way beyond Tesla.  I believe the current skepticism around Silicon Valley's &quot;Make The World a Better Place&quot; mentality is deeply rooted in historical anxiety about institutional capitalism.  I don't think this anxiety is misplaced.  Rather, I think that technology, specifically the World Wide Web presents a &quot;way out&quot; of this dilemma.  It will take time, but ultimately, the Web's power is that it can mimic the &quot;accountability&quot; aspect of local transactions, but on a global scale.  This will be the subject of Part 2 of this essay.  For now, let's talk about some more game theory.</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>There's another game, informally called &quot;guess the average&quot;.  The idea is this:  Take a group of 100 people, and tell each person to pick a number between 1 and 100.  The goal for each individual is to guess <strong>2/3</strong> the average of whatever the group guesses.  The closest guess to the average wins.</p>

<p>Let's say everyone else guesses completely randomly.  In this case, the average would be 50.  The correct answer, in this case, would be 33.</p>

<p>This answer, it turns out, is not very stable.  If everybody in the room realizes this, then the average answer is going to be 33.  Meaning, the new &quot;correct&quot; answer (2/3 of the new average) is now 22.</p>

<p>If everybody in the room guesses 22, the new correct answer is 14.  And so on.  We've recreated my favorite scene from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_eZmEiyTo0">Princess Bride</a> -- a pure guessing game.  The final equilbrium answer for this game is 0, if everybody understands these mechanics fully.</p>

<p>Now, here's where things get interesting.  Suppose you know all of this.  Let's say that, after you read this article, I put you in a room with 99 strangers and ask you to play the &quot;guess the average&quot; game.  What number do you guess?  Guess one.  Write it down.</p>

<p>The correct answer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_2/3_of_the_average#Experimental_results">it turns outs</a>, is 22.  Huh.  Why is that?</p>

<p>Given any group of 99 people to play this game with, the answer you choose becomes much more interesting.  You have to effectively guess what % of the group is going to guess the naive answer (33).  You have to guess which % of the group will guess the one-level deep answer (22).  And so on.  It turns out, you can reliably guess that most people won't think more than one or two levels deep.  Now, if this essay goes viral (please don't, I haven't configured Varnish yet), and everybody realizes the correct answer is 22, then you'd guess 14...</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>Why does this matter?</p>

<p>What I've just described is a <em>cough</em> mathematical <em>cough</em> basis for explaining what's called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest">Keynesian beauty contest</a>.  That is, a KBC is any situation where you're guessing <em>what everyone else is going to guess</em> rather than deducing some underlying or real value.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient market hypothesis</a> (and therefore the entire stock market) is based off of this.  All of mass communication, in fact, relies on guessing what assumptions your target audience holds and tailoring your message to meet the &quot;average&quot; of that group.</p>

<p>I believe that, when you take these two games in combination, you've created an extremely potent mechanism to prevent any kind of optimistic or cooperation-seeking behavior from emerging in our economy.  The fact is, even <em>if</em> you accept the difference in Pareto/Nash outcomes described above, you still need to deal with the fact that you're a lone voice in a huge Keynesian beauty contest.  And there's so much momentum toward negativity, toward 0, that it seems almost impossible to escape the trap.  Perhaps, as some have suggested, we should start looking for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A">exit</a>.</p>

<p>The only hope is cultural change.  Hi, my name is Chris, this is my blog, I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>That's it for now.  In the next piece, I'll talk about how the World Wide Web changes the game (heh heh) for some of these assumptions we've subconciously held as fundamental, and how dog-eat-dog capitalism, at least in its current form, is on its way out.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q4zz6HvdiM">Optimistic</a>, huh?</p>
