<p>Recently, I've started recording myself playing guitar so I can hear myself played back, correct any vocal errors, and practice being in front of an &quot;audience&quot;.  I pretend like I'm going to upload these videos to the internet.  One day, I thought hey, why not actually upload them?  None of my friends know my Youtube username, so I should be safe from any embarassment.</p>

<p>I uploaded one.  An hour or two later, I'm on my Gplus page, and bam, there it is.  Shared with all of my circles.  Luckily, I don't have too many friends on Gplus.  I might have died of embarassment if it reached Facebook.</p>

<p>Since 2011, there has been a lot of <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/thanks-for-nothing-jerkface-7000030306">controversy</a> surrounding Google +'s &quot;Real Names&quot; policy, and this finally made something click.  I think the so-called &quot;Nymwars&quot; are a symptom of a larger problem our society is facing.  Luckily, I think it will solve itself with time.  However, understanding what's happening could help us ease the transition, and make things less painful for those caught in the undertow.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/fuck-bitches-get-leid-the-sleazy-frat-emails-of-snap-1582604137">emails</a> surfaced written by Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel during his time as a fraternity leader at Stanford.  The content of the emails were shocking, atrocious, and unbefitting of a CEO of a billion dollar corporation.  They were also, if you have ever set foot on an American university, entirely unsurprising.  What's interesting about this case compared to the recent slew of Gawkerazzi scandals is that the outrage seems significantly more mild compared to what happened wtih Donald Sterling or Brendan Eich.  Why is that?</p>

<p>Here's an enlightening question:  Could Spiegalgate have occured in the 1980s?  Email didn't exist, silly, of course it couldn't.  As banal as that answer is, it forms the crux of the argument I'd like to present today:  Google's Real Names policy, scandals sustained by the SJW media machine, troubling questions about NSA spying and privacy online, and a whole host of other problems can be traced to a single question foisted upon us by the emergence of the World Wide Web; a question we have not yet answered.  I believe it's one of the most important questions we face as a society:  How should our social norms evolve given that we now have free, instant, worldwide communication?</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>Many adults, in the privacy of conversation with peers, use cuss words.  We seem to be fine with this.  Once a toddler or an elderly person enter the room, however, the situation changes.  There is a new <em>conversational context</em>, one which prohibits excessive profanity.</p>

<p>Let's pause here.  What's going on?  On a high level, every conversation has a context.  <em>Which</em> context depends on many things:  The individuals involved, their shared history, the cultural environment, events ocurring before and during the conversation, history.  There are thousands of factors that regulate context.  Context determines, among other things, which words and thoughts are appropriate to express in a given situation.  More broadly speaking, context is an integral part of meaning.  If commmunication is about delivering <strong>meaning</strong>, then meaning is found in the intersection between <strong>words</strong> and <strong>context</strong>.  Words outside of context have no meaning, or a least, have a radically different meaning than the author was trying to express.  Thus, when you remove context, you kill conversation.</p>

<p>Context is crazily complicated to piece out.  It's one of the most complex disciplines in the philosophy of language, and much has been written about it.  It's hard to argue that context is anything but a fundamental part of communication.</p>

<p>The Internet, by its nature, eliminates 100% of the context behind a conversation.  Words are no longer relative to the people involved, their shared history, etc.  And this simple observation, I believe, is having massive ripple effects across our cultural world.</p>

<p>The problem of the Internet eliminating context is an important one, but by itself, usually harmless to the author.  The problem I want to address is:  What happens when people <em>inject</em> their own context into someone else's words?  Short answer:  It's not good.  Why would somebody do that?</p>

<p>Most of the time, this isn't done on purpose.  It's usually just simple psychology.  For instance.  Say you have a long discussion with a friend about feminism.  When the conversation ends, you go online and you read an article about the Snapchat emails.  The conversation with your friend is fresh in your mind.  What's happening, psychologically, is that you <em>carry over</em> some of the context from your previous conversation into what you're currently reading.  This happens by default, <em>unless it is checked by some entity along the information chain to inject the proper context.</em></p>

<p>Typically there are three people able to set context in the information chain.  The recipient, the media, and the author.  I think that the job of context-setting can justifyably fall on any or all of these parties' shoulders.  The question we need to ask ourselves, is:  Whose job <em>should</em> it be if our goal is to create the best cultural environment to foster innovation, excellence, and all of those other good things we want people to talk about and produce?</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>In absence of all else, <em>by default</em> we expect the author to communicate the context.  I think this is a healthy paradigm for authors deliberately trying to make a point.  If you want your message to reach the largest audience possible, and you don't trust the media to set context properly, it is your duty to make yourself understandable to as many people as you can.  The influence your words have is directly proportional to how well those words resonate with your intended audience.  Furthermore, you must make sure that any atomic piece of your statement cannot be taken out of context by the audience or the media.  It's extremely difficult, but ultimately vital if your aim is to influence how mass amounts of people think and behave.</p>

<p>This assumption fails when the author is not <em>deliberately</em> trying to make a point.  I think most (~95%) of the words we use are not carefully chosen to reach the maximum audience possible.  When we talk to close friends, we don't make absolutely sure our words fully communicate our intent to each of the Earth's six billion people.  Usually, we rely on context to deviver part of the message.</p>

<p>The prominence of the Internet introduces vastly more situations where the author is not deliberate.  And because the Web is such an effective way to communicate to everybody, more and more of these &quot;private&quot; conversations are starting to appear online.  The problem, as we'll see, is that it becomes harder to reinforce the contextual boundries between different conversations.  If you send a group email, it is increasingly easier for just one recipient to copy/paste your message into an entirely different medium/context.  This not only eliminates meaning, but opens the door for new insiduous behaviors.</p>

<p>One troubling implication of this technology is that it becomes dangerously easy to take an author's words, link them to a separate area of the internet, <em>inject your own context</em>, and interpet the author's &quot;meaning&quot; to be whatever suits your political or commercial agenda.  I don't think most people do this deliberately, but lines are definitely blurred when money is thrown into the mix.  I'll get back to this.</p>

<p>What are some alternatives?</p>

<p>Another method of setting context involves individuals on the <em>recieving</em> end.  I think this is the best way to handle context in an ideal world, and it's a philosophy I personally subscribe to.  One mark of wisdom is the ability to look at situations from multiple angles, to consider many points of view.  In regards to our current discussion, one way to think about wisdom is that wisdom is the measure of how many contexts you've collected, understand, and are able to switch between given an author's words or any other set of phenomena.</p>

<p>I think most smart people will agree.  <that one article about fiction books giving you perspective></p>

<p>Unfortunately, given the way our society is set up, it's not feasible to rely on the average person to understand the nuances of context.  I will return to this point in future essays, but for now, let's just assume that most people are unwilling to consider context and prefer to take things at face value, and that we somehow have to work around this.</p>

<p>Where does that leave us?  I suspect you've guessed my conclusion.  Traditionally, it is the duty of the media to represent an author's meaning, not as words in the abstract, but alongside the proper context.  <em>This is one of the hardest things to do reliably</em>, and in the golden age of journalism, was quite an important part of your job as a reporter.</p>

<p>This doesn't seem to be a big priority anymore.</p>

<p>A lot has been written about the degredation of journalistic ethic due to the influence of capitalism.  I don't think I can add much here other than noting that the Web brings this issue into clear focus.  Since we've built this staggering array of tools that support content monetization -- advertising, affiliates, marketing, etc. -- , the path between &quot;saying stuff&quot; and &quot;making money&quot; has become a lot shorter.  A necessary consequence of that is it becomes easier to say whatever it is you want to say and make a boat load of money doing it.  The entire Gawker empire is based off of an almost nihilistic view of objective reality in service of making a quick buck.</p>

<p>There's a bigger problem to discuss about capitalism, but I won't get into it here.  All I'll say is that due to the elevation of all-business-is-good style of capitalism that has captured the modern intellectual elite, the duty of the media to set context becomes harder and harder to justify as new technology rewards shallow connections in lieu of deep connections.  Because the Internet has made it easy to reach increasingly large audiences, it has become way more profitable to tailor journalism to the shallow-end of reporting.  In a nutshell, the incentive structure capitalism hosits upon media companies becomes further misaligned with the ideal way information should be presented -- with careful attention to nuance, detail, and context.  We're just now starting to feel the consequences of this misalignment, and I think the pain is just starting to surface.</p>

<p>I don't have any answers right now.  The point of this essay is to look at communciation -- specifically, commuincation along the World Wide Web -- as a complex system.  Any party along the information chain has the power to prevent miscommunication.  The question we now need to ask ourselves is -- whose job <em>should</em> it be?</p>
